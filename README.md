Hi there, I’m Jeanne, aka Jenny Kao. 

I’m a data scientist with a background in performance marketing. At the same time, I am pursuing my MSc degree in Applied Data Science at University of Michigan - Ann Arbor.

🌱 I’m currently learning graph theory and casual modeling.

💞️ If you would like to collaborate on projects around sustainability, agriculture, operations planning and think I may be of help, you could reach me via email at jenny.kaoic@gmail.com
